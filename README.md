Project for Soen 341 team G

## Objective

Develop an online shopping website

## Project

As conventional shopping becomes more dangerous due to the pandemic, the need to shop online needs to be filled. This website is meant to represent a basic template for an online shopping platform. It provides a profile system to allow for membership deals, a basic search bar to locate what the customer needs quickly without scrolling through a long page, online cart that can have items added, removed or have the number purchased and size specifications modified, and the systems needed to obtain the money needed from the consumer's credit or debit card in order to finish the purchase.
